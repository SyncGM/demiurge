== Demiurge

Demiurge is a program designed to simplify the management of the popular
"Note tag" style of script configuration. It is also capable of acting as an
extensible database if one possesses a basic knowledge of the way that JRuby
interfaces with Java|scripters can even make use of Swing GUI designers to
create custom tags, reducing both the amount of work involved and the knowledge
of Java required.

For the average user, Demiurge can be considered nothing but a fancy Database
addon. For scripters, Demiurge opens up an extraordinarily wide realm of options
that were closed in the past.
